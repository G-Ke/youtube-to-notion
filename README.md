# YouTube to Notion

**Note:** *This is a work in progress and is not operational at this time.*

## Ok it doesn't work, but what is it?

This project is designed to access YouTube's Data API v3 and grab metadata for each video in my playlists. It will store the data in an SQLite DB and then move that data to Notion. There is more I have planned for this project, but the current goal is to handle backing up my YouTube playlists.
